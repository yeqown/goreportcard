        <p>Go Report Card was initially developed during <a
                    href="http://gophergala.com/blog/gopher/gala/2015/02/03/winners/">Gopher Gala 2015</a>. It is free,
            open source and run by volunteers. If you feel like there is something that could be improved, we encourage
            you to <a href="https://github.com/yeqown/goreportcard">open an issue or contribute on GitHub</a>!</p>
